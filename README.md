# Gap or Cap - A Discord Bot Made Because of an In-Joke

This is a small-scale project which serves to translate an in-joke from when me and my friends play fighting games, into a simple Discord bot created in JavaScript that allowed me to work with the language in a project that I actually finished.

I very much enjoyed developing this project and I can even see myself coming back to it in the future, to add other fun features that come to mind!


## Installations

For this bot, you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, and you will need to run the following commands in the terminal in the root of your project:

```
npm install discord.js
npm install djs-commander
npm install dotenv 
```

## Setup

To set this up this bot for yourself, I would recommend looking at the [official quickstart guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started) on Discord's website, which will detail how to create your own application.

Other than that, setting it up for yourself is as simple as getting the Application ID, Public Key, and Bot Token from your own Discord application, and then setting up your `.env` file with these values.

## Acknowledgements (I Guess)

At the end here I just wanted to thank, and credit Lewis, Cole, and Roberto for helping with writing the example sentences! (and by that I mean coming up with most of them)
